# magic_link_up

Initial repo was magic_links (27 commits) but i had to restructure in order to get the application deployed to Heroku. Took me about 2 days in the Django docs to create the project with full functionality and 2 days to get it deployed to Heroku. 

All necessary packages are in the requirements.txt file in the root folder. Did not use a virtual enviroment. 

Django + PostgreSQL application to store lots of links for easy access and basic filtering. 

More improvements on this app to come. First time coding something in Python not from a tutorial. 

Application is deployed to Heroku right now. Here is the live link to my first Python web app.
