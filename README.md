# magic_link_up

Initial repo was magic_links but i had to restructure in order to get the application deployed to Heroku.
All necessary packages are in the requirements.txt file in the root folder.

Django + PostgreSQL application to store lots of links for easy access and basic filtering. 

More improvements on this app to come. First time coding something in Python not from a tutorial. 

Application is deployed to Heroku right now. I will have the link to the site here shortly working out one last issue.
